# Welcome note

Welcome to my Github repository of *Learning Pandas from Zero*! This is my first open source book project for building a systematic tutorial notes for covering the basic use of Pandas. These tutorial matieral in compliment with the YouTube video tutorial series available on my channel. So feel free to take a look there if you prefer learning new programming skills by videos. 

The whole series aims at programmers who are still new in Python and who want to use Pandas for their spreadsheet operations. You don't need to be very experienced in Python. It will be great if you know basic operations of Python:

* Declare variables
* List and dictionary operations
* Declare and call function
* Some simple understanding about NumPy arrays

I do not assume learners to be acquainted with concepts in external libraries of Python. Whenever these concepts are used, we will do a quick recapitulation so that readers may quickly pick up the essential in these libraries so that they can follow the progress in the tutorial notes. 

In designing the tutorial note, I try to group the relevant methods and functionality accordingly to different topics, like merging dataframe, or statistical analysis, or editing a dataframe. This will allow me to explore systematically different possibilities in dealing with the data. I imagined myself if I do not know Pandas, what would I want to learn next if I want to take the next step in Pandas. This question drives the current structure of this book. 

In this tutorial note series, we will go through step-by-step a number of operations related to Dataframe:

* how to create a dataframe
* access the dataframe
* edit, modify a dataframe
* processing multiple dataframes
* statistical analysis of a dataframe
* visualization of a dataframe

I hope that by taking these progressive steps, you will feel confident in handling a large database by yourself for your future data project!

Finally, it will be great when I could receive your feedback in what kind of new content or examples we can add in these tutorial notes so that new learners can benefit more in this tutorial series!
